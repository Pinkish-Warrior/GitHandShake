# Open Source Navigator - Client Application

This directory contains the Next.js frontend application for the Open Source Navigator project.

## Script Explanations

* `dev`: Starts the Next.js development server. This is what you'd typically run during development, providing features like hot module reloading.
* `build`: Compiles the Next.js application for production deployment. This generates optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
* `start`: Serves the production build of the Next.js application. You would run this after `build` to launch the compiled app.
* `lint`: Runs `eslint` to check the client-side code for style guide violations and potential errors.
